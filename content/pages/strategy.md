  title: Irbisio’s principles of cleantech investing
  body: "Investing in cleantech provides a unique opportunity for investors to
    generate financial returns while also contributing to a more sustainable
    future.  Our investment principles are guided by clear understanding and
    technical acumen in assessing growth potential, key players and potential
    risks:"
  principles:
    - title: Legal and political framework
      body: " Cleantech is often affected by government regulations, so it's important
        to understand the regulatory environment in which companies are
        operating. Government incentives and subsidies can provide a boost to
        cleantech companies, and changes in regulations can have a significant
        impact on their success."
    - title: Diversification
      body: This is a key principle of investing in any industry, including cleantech.
        This means spreading the investment across a range of companies and
        technologies to minimise risk and maximise returns.
    - title: Impact investing
      body: Cleantech investment is expected to generate a positive impact on society
        or the environment in addition to financial returns. Impact investing is
        a powerful motivator for investors looking to make a positive difference
        in the world.
    - title: Clearly defined timeframes
      body: Cleantech is often referred to as a long-term investment, with years or
        even decades before returns are seen. However the energy transition is
        changing the landscape and timescales for cleantech investing and
        offering investors the opportunity to make strong returns over a
        relatively short period.
    - title: Risk management
      body: " Cleantech companies are often at the forefront of new and innovative
        technologies and have often been associated with high-risk investing.
        Technology due diligence and implementation expertise are the core of
        de-risking these investments and companies and realising the potential
        to generate significant returns."
    - title: Due diligence
      body: As with any investment, it's crucial to perform due diligence to
        understand the financial and operational risks involved in cleantech
        investing.
    - title: ESG factors
      body: These are integral to cleantech. Factors include the company's impact on
        the environment, its treatment of employees, and its governance and
        transparency.
  footer: Cleantech is a unique opportunity to generate financial returns while
    contributing to a more sustainable future. By understanding the market,
    diversifying your investments, considering ESG factors, and performing due
    diligence, investors can maximise their returns and make a positive impact.
