  sub_heading: The Irbisio Growth Fund is focussed on capital growth returns
    through investments in cleantech programmes. While contributing to the
    carbon net zero goal, these investments offer higher returns to investors
    based on a more ambitious risk profile.
  opportunity: We select, implement and scale up cleantech projects in the mid and
    small market. As new technologies emerge from the subsidised R&D phase into
    the profitable deployment phase, we seize the opportunity to generate
    predictable returns for our investors.
