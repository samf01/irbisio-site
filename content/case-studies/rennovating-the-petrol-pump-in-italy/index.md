## Location: Italy

#### Duration: 1.5 years

For a business that is providing energy to others, fuel stations are also large energy users themselves. Pumps and other electrical equipment require power and often these are outdated and inefficient.

Irbisio worked with a chain of petrol stations in Italy to upgrade the electrical infrastructure and thus significantly reduce energy consumption.

The €6m project was completed with the energy savings shared as income to the petrol station owners and the investors through a mechanism of fixed leasing payments. Investors also gained returns though Government green credits that provide a second income stream.
