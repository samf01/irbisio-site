Food manufacturing generates significant waste that is often just discarded – despite its potential to be used to generate biomethane as a clean source of energy that be sold commercially for many applications.

Irbisio is working with a US-based biomethane company that is building a waste processing plant next to a large food processing factory. The investment of €9m will see the project completed so that waste can be turned into profit.

In an example of how a circular economy can function, the food processing company will become a purchaser of the biomethane to power the food production process. Plans are also underway to scale up the reprocessing plant to accommodate other sources of food waste, with excess gas being sold independently.
