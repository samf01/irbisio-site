Social housing can often be energy inefficient, especially so when the housing stock is older.  Today Governments often offer strong financial incentives to regenerate energy inefficient homes though better insulation and modern lighting. 

Irbisio identified a cluster of social housing in the Genoa area that requires an energy efficiency upgrade. The investment to do this is matched by the Italian Government’s offer repay the redevelopment costs by 110% and so provide a 10% premium to investors. 

Depending on the stage of investments, real yields can be even higher because some margin is also generated at the construction phase.
